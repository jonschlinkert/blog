# Sponsor

Hi, I'm Jon! I'm a full-time open source software developer and single dad.

Several years ago I switched careers from sales, marketing and consulting to learn how to program, with the goal of making the world a better place through code. Whether that means giving people access to information, the tools and technology to level the playing field with big corporations, or empowering people in impoverished regions to participate in the world economy.

To date, I've created more than 1,000 open source projects in an effort to reach my goal. Open source software takes a lot of time to create and maintain. You can help me to achieve my goals of changing the world through code, help me create better developer experiences, or just say thank you by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/jonschlinkert) me on GitHub, or via my [paypal.me page](https://paypal.me/jonathanschlinkert?locale.x=en_US).

Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated!
